    "First, a word about the print command.  Python will print whatever appears inside of the ().  If the contents of the parentheses are also enclosed inside quotation marks (\",',''',or \"\"\") then python prints what literally appears inside of the quoatations.  If, however, some kind of operation, expression, or variable appears inside of the quoataions, Python performs that operation or reduces that expression first, and then prints the results.  If the of the () is a variable, Python will print the value assigned to that variable.  For example, print ('5+3') will result in 5+3 and print (5+3) will result in 8.  If my_varialbe = 1005, print ('my_variable') will print my_variable and print (my_variable) will print 1005. \n",

    "__Line 1)__  The first line first performs the addition operation on the terms enclosed by the parenthese.  The print command tells the computer to print the result of our addition operation.\n",

    "__Line 2)__  The second line first performs the exponentiation operation by raising 2 to the 8th power.  The print command then tells the computer to print the result of our exponentiation operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Line 3)__  The third line demonstrates the use of parentheses in controlling the order of arithmetic operations.  Python performs the arithmetic operations using the following rules of precedence: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.  Since (1+4) and (9-6) are in parentheses, these operations are performed first and then the sum (5) and difference (3), respectively, are multiplied resulting in 15.  "
